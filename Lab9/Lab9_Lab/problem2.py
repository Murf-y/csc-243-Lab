"""
Design and write a complete Application program that ask the user to enter an integer N and simulates the roll two dies N times (N being a large number such 10000 times). Your program should count and output the number and percentage of occurrences of each 

â€¢	Implement and use a function roll that simulate the rolling of a Die:
Def roll():
   # () -> int
   # returns a random number between 1 and 6

â€¢	Include in the application a prompt for re-running the simulation.
